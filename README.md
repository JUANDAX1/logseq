# Logseq

I started this repo as a way to publish my Logseq templates to the world :)

It's updated every so often as different parts of my system start to crystallize.

To use these templates, download the 'templates.md' file and copy it to the 'pages' folder in your Logseq root folder.

Then in Logseq, bring up the desired template by using the forward slash command '/'.

And that's it!
